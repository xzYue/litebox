/// Some shims need support for deriving keys that survives past reboots (for example, to support
/// secure storage). Such keys are derived from some device-specific secret (called `root_key`) and
/// some `context`, and a key derivation function (KDF).
///
/// Platforms might differ drastically on their own notion of device-specific secrets, and what
/// "reboot-surviving" means. Some platforms might have a real never-revealed never-modified root
/// key (e.g., TPMs), while others might maintain a persistent key across LiteBox invocations,
/// but that persistent-key might be re-initialized to a new value every "real" reboot, etc.
///
/// Concretely, no shim can depend _directly_ on the existence of a device-specific secret. However,
/// interestingly, for cryptographically strong KDFs where you do not know the root key,
/// `KDF(root_key, context)` is indistinguishable from `KDF(KDF'(root_key, context'), context)`, etc.
/// Thus, while some shims might be particular about their choice of KDF, and platforms might be
/// particular about their choice of KDFs, they can mutually-distrustingly just simply run two KDFs
/// if needed. For performance reasons however, this is not ideal to be forced always, and thus this
/// specific provider supports a model that allows for more pragmatic choices, while making sure
/// that the platform has final say on the total strictness of the root key (since it is what
/// finally owns the root key).
